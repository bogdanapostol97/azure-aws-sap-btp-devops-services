Deploy the application to SAP BTP using the automated pipeline.
Monitor the deployment and application performance using SAP Cloud ALM.

Best Practices for DevOps Services
Version Control
Use Git-based repositories to manage code versions and enable collaboration.
Implement branch policies to maintain code quality and facilitate code reviews.
Automated Testing
Integrate automated tests into your CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.
Use a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for comprehensive coverage.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
Automate the build, test, and deployment processes to reduce manual errors and speed up releases.
Use multi-stage pipelines to control the flow from development to production environments.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Use IaC tools (e.g., Azure Resource Manager, AWS CloudFormation, SAP BTP Command Line Interface) to manage infrastructure.
Version control your infrastructure definitions to track changes and enable reproducibility.
Monitoring and Logging
Implement monitoring and logging to gain insights into application performance and health.
Use alerting to proactively manage issues and reduce downtime.
Security
Incorporate security checks into your CI/CD pipelines (e.g., static code analysis, dependency scanning).
Manage access controls and use encryption to protect sensitive information.
